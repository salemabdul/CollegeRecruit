# CollegeRecruit
I analyzed a college recruitment data set that I got from Kaggle. I used python to analyze the data set. I did value counts of the variables and I also found maximum and minimum of some of the variables as well. I made pie charts, histograms, bar charts, and box and whisker plots. One of the pie charts that I had showed a percentage of people who were male that got placed and the percentage of males that did not get placed. I also did the same for females. One of the histograms I had was a histogram that showed the different salaries of people and how frequent they were. I had another one where it showed the different employ ability test scores and how frequent they were.
